### Requirements
To run the server, you need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed and configured on your machine.

To install Node.js, download it from its [website](http://nodejs.org) or run `find-node-or-install.sh` in a Terminal.

Once Node is installed, open a terminal at the root of the project and run `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies needed to execute the program.

### Running the app
Open a terminal at the root of the project and run `npm start` to launch the server. By default it will listen the `8080` port of your machine.
